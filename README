Building
--------

You need the whole set of autotools, gettext, and gnulib.

Generate all the infrastructure files with
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make

OR

Generate a Debian package
$ debuild -I.git -I.gitignore -us -uc
$ cd ..
$ sudo dpkg -i hangon_0.1_i386.deb # or whatever it is called
